# FDA-Total-Diet-Study-Analytics-Toolset
Analytics toolset for processing and understanding analtical results from the FDA Total Diet Study

**NOTE:** There is no warranty or guarantee of performance or quality data from this toolset. Please perform your own research and consult with a medical professional before acting on any conclusions formed from looking at this data! 

*The [FDA Total Diet Study](https://www.fda.gov/food/science-research-food/total-diet-study) (TDS) monitors levels of nutrients (e.g., calcium and iron) and contaminants (e.g., cadmium and lead) in foods commonly eaten by people in the U.S. The TDS complements FDAâ€™s other food safety and nutrition programs.*

Analytical data for TDS can be found [here](https://www.fda.gov/food/total-diet-study/analytical-results-total-diet-study)

## Data Quality, Varying Results

There are widely varying results in published data regarding the nickel, copper, and cobalt content of basic foods. The TDS analytical dataset is used in this toolset, and this data might conflict with other published data.

One can see how the published data would vary so widely if the source of the sample is taken into consideration. Maybe the wind was blowing the right direction from a steel mill to have a higher concentraion of nickel and cobalt in a particular batch of fruit. Perhaps some food processing equipment was failing as it was grinding meat, leaving small microscopic traces of metals in some run of ground beef.

These variations in nutrient content would not harm a person that did not suffer from some Systemic Metal Allergy, but it to those that are sensitive, it is realy harmful.

## Project Focus

This analytical toolset is being built in order to help folks with Systemic Metal Allergies, such as Nickel and Cobalt, better understand what foods to avoid.
